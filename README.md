# bike-help

This is an app that helps cyclists in need for a quick fix for their bike. Along their way, people encounter common ennoying problems like a flat tire. At the same time, there might be people closeby who happen to have a little time and the right tools to help out. Bike Help wants to connect these people and contribute to an active bike culture.

## User Story 1: Basic Layout

### Value Proposition

As a user
I want to intuitively understand the layout and where I can access main functions of the app.

### Acceptance Criteria

- a header shows the title of the app and a drop-down menu for additional info and options
- a footer gives access to the three main features - the map, profile and create a new request
- the page looks fine on a small device like a smartphone

### Tasks

- create a placeholder for the map, like a jpg
- create a header with burger-menu and important entries
- create a footer with proper layout and 3 symbols for the main functions
- all links should be clickable but just redirect to main

## User Story 2: Map

### Value Proposition

As a user
I want to see the main component of the app, which is the map. I want to be able to move it around and ideally see my location.

### Acceptance Criteria

- a functional map is displayed
- the user can navigate on it
- the layout of the app will not be effected
- the map should accept entries and modifications

### Tasks

- integrate a suitable map solution
